# BLOCK'TIVITY 

www.blocktivity.info

### Introduction

Blocktivity has started by showing some important data concerning the blockchain field. It should evolve and give more valuable information. I want to create an environment where blockchain passionates can gather and get relevant information. There is tons of analysis, data and charts that can be done on blockchains and little has been done so far. 

We are still at the dawn of the blockchain revolution my dear passionate friends, let's wax our boards, a big wave is coming ... 

### Where are we now ?

Right now Blocktivity is made with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. It has been coded from start to end with my very limited coding skills. Instead of working on a bike and trying to transform it into a poorly functional car, I would suggest we start from scratch and make a rocket!
 
The Scorum (scorumcoins.com) team had the kindness to work on a demo and I'm very impressed by what they have done. You'll find the images and video of this demo in the docs/ directory. 

I'm learning JS, Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js and MongoDB. As soon as I'm confident with my learing, I'll write write the first scripts that will read the blockchain blocks to fill my database and render it in a beautiful frontend. You'll find the information on the data I want to collect in the file "DATA_DB.md"

### Important documents (These docs are made to be edited by anyone!) 

- [TODO_LIST.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md) 
- [IDEAS.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md)   
- [DATA_DB.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/DATA_DB.md)   

### What can you do ? 

Have a look at the [TODO_LIST.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md) file. Suggest an idea ([IDEAS.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md)) or think about what kind of data would be nice to add into the Bocktivity database ([DATA_DB.md](https://github.com/blocktivity-info/blocktivity/blob/master/DATA_DB.md)) for later charts, tables or analysis.
